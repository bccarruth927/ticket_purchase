# Ticket Purchase Webpage

This project was a part of the CMST 388 course *Fundamentals of JavaScript* provided by UMGC. Below are a list of features I created using JavaScript to complete the assignment requirements. I also utilized this project as an opportuity to practice more Git commands and workflow to better master my skills using the tool.

## Features

There are a few unique features to this webpage that I implemented to test various skills with JavaScript. Listed are the focal features of the project:

- A countdown timer
- Function with an onchange event that changes the price input based on the number of tickets ordered
- Function that alerts the user of a successful purchase

### Additional Features

- The countdown timer will alert the user of timer expiration upon reaching 00:00 and reload the webpage
- The onchange function also includes inbedded validation components and will alert the user or incorrect data
  - The onchange function also displays other form elements if correct data is entered
- The function that completes the ticket purchase includes imbedded validation components and will alert the user of incorrect data

## How to Use

Use of this webpage is straightforward. Users first read the instructions for purchasing tickets and then proceed to enter a desired number of tickets. If the entered
number of tickets is valid the total cost changes to reflect the cost of the tickets as well as reveal additional form elements. The user then enters their name and a 
valid email address. If the user is satisfied with their form entry they can click **Purchase Tickets** to complete their order or reset the form data. If the countdown
timer expires before the user completes their ticket purchase they recieve an alert and the webpage is reloaded.
